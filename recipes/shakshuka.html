    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mexican-inspired shakshuka recipe is a one-skillet poached egg dish hearty enough to feed a crowd. It's full of all the flavors you expect from Mexican recipes — tomatoes, onions, smoked peppers, cumin, chili powders, and Spanish paprika. Serve with warmed corn or flour tortillas and butter-fried hominy.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) jar roasted red bell peppers, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Hunt's® Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ancho chile powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Spanish paprika</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans Hunt's® Diced Tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
        
  
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion in hot oil until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add roasted peppers and garlic; sauté until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, chili powders, cumin, and paprika. Sauté until well combined, 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes and water. Season with salt and pepper. Raise heat to medium-high and bring mixture to a boil. Immediately reduce heat to medium and cook for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a well in tomato mixture for each egg; pour 1 egg into each well. Cover; poach until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, 2 1/2 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
